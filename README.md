ARRANGEMENT - SOURCE CODE - JANUARY 30TH 2011
======================

Introduction
----------

This is the source code of the Half-Life 1 total conversion : ARRANGEMENT.

[This source code has been released by ARRANGEMENT's creator Claudio "SysOp" Ficara on the ARRANGEMENT's forums in **January 30th 2011**](http://am.half-lifecreations.com/forums/index.php?topic=1155.0). **With the exception of this README and licenses adapted to the Markdown format, nothing has been changed.** The main purpose of having the source code uploaded on GitHub is to have a "Git ready" version.

Please note that this source code **doesn't represent the latest/actual version of the game.**

Usage
----------

In order to compile the source code, you **must use Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0**. It is also recommended to have the Service Pack 6 installed as well.

In order to run the mod, you **must have the game assets and a Steam account with Half-Life 1 installed**, you can download the game assets from **August 5th 2012** [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10323577/am.pre.20120805.rar).

If you consider creating a Half-Life 1 mod or total conversation using features from this source code. **We highly recommend that you use a clean Half-Life 1 source code (2.3/GitHub/Xash3D) and use this source code as reference**.

A word of warning : you may also find some code (mostly comments) written in Spanish instead of English.

Maintenance
----------

**No support will be offered for this source code, this means that any issue report/pull request will be denied/ignored** because the latest/actual version of the game use another source code than this one.
