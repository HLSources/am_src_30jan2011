    <h2>:: introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The AVIKit library is copyright (c) 2003-2004, Ruari O'Sullivan. For
      license information, see license.txt.
    </p><p>
      AVIKit is an open-source library for reading video and audio streams
      from AVIs under Windows. It is targeted towards using videos in
      virtual worlds, and is capable of seperating interleaved audio
      channels for correct spatial representation in virtual worlds (as
      demonstrated by the akdemo3d and AKHL sample applications).
    </p><p>
      That said, this is the technical reference manual for using the AVIKit
      library in your project, or projects. AVIKit was designed with the
      express purpose of being used, so I've tried to make this as simple
      as possible.
    </p>
    <h2>:: using this documentation</h2>
    <p>
      This documentation is split into two major parts. The first part, usage,
      goes through how to use AVIKit and the provided buffer management to
      perform anything you are likely to want to do: playing AVIs with or
      without stereo or mono 2d or 3d sound, using DirectSound, FMod or any
      sound API whatsoever that lets you pass it sound data for audio, and
      using OpenGL, Direct3D, a GUI or perhaps a custom software renderer to
      show the image in 2D or 3D space. I recommend reading the entirety of
      the usage section if you want to play audio streams, or just the first
      two parts if you intend to ignore audio.
    </p><p>
      The second part, a function reference, gives a blow-by-blow lowdown on
      what the individual functions in the AVIKit and buffer management class
      do. This is more for reference as you program. Again, if you do not
      intend to use buffer management, you can completely ignore the
      AVIKitBuffer buffer management class.
    </p><p>
      Finally, for convenience, links are provided to the documentation for
      the library samples and for the library as a whole - in readme.txt and
      license.txt.
