1 - LIST OF FEATURES AND DESCRIPTION OF AM

[Description of HL:Arrangement]

Arrangement, a Half-Life 1 Modification
Forget about all minor modifications you played. 
Arrangement let's you feel in the skin of Fred Thompson when he starts to work for "The Agency", a secret organization to protect the world against terrorists groups.
When he accept the job, the missions starts to be part of his life. Playing as Fred you will meet a lot of new scenaries in lot of places in the world.
Our codders works hard to try to change some things to make bigger and detailed maps. On Am, a lot of props are used, more than a normal Half-Life map can support. Almost forget, on Am you will see realistic rain, snow, fog, dust and new effects that you never seen. Thanks that, our mappers can make a very detailed maps to give you a very realistic an inmersive game.
For mission purposes, you will use a lot of equipment, such as Lockpicks, Pistols, Large guns, grenades, Syringes, Flashlights, NVG, Parachutes, vehicles... and more... Each weapon has a secondary fire for add silencers, turn on termal vision, zoom, scope and more.
Arrangement mix a real FPS whit a RPG style. So that, you can earn XP points when you kill some enemies. Of course, headshots scores better than a simple kill, and a burned enemy scores better than a enemy killed by a headshot and so on... Those XP points will let you use new abilities, buy weapons, make kung-fu kicks, and more...
Am also includes new technological improvements. You can turn on/off whenever you want to best performance (by Advanced Menu).
S2P Physics let's you fell how the enemies react very well when you shoot at them. Any weapon or item will fall and bounce in a realistic manner. It also align monsters and weapons to floor, prevent "model clip" when you kill them, simulate GTA:SA ragdoll and much more.

BG Particle-Grass system it's a new concept of effects in-game. Thanks that you can see realist fire, smoke, snow, blood, wall puffs, fog and so on… You can add those particle managers whit just a simple entity and you can edit each param in-game! It means you can test so easily your particle system fast and so better. You can also increase-decease the amount of particles accesing a Cvar command (for best qualitiy-performance)
For C-17 maps your can add HL2 Monster entities and weapons too. All new weapons, effects, sounds and more are avaiable for you, if you want to create a new SP game.
Arrangement it's also better to mapping purposes. Add new prop entitites it's very easy. You can also select your own model for each weapon, item, and monster enemies. There's included all Spirit of Half-Life improvements (not Movewhit or Locus system by now) as well. It's so easy to map. Thanks to VHE 3.5 we can show models on map and create a new concept of mapping.
But that's not the best part. You have the code avaiable to fit your own needs. Instead of add AGEiA Physics and all those graphical improvements, we worked hard to try make a new mod whit all you want: new gameplay, new weapons, all common enemies and allies and new effects.

If you're codder and you have a good modeller and a good mapper, I'm sure you can make a new very impressive Mod so easily. 

Go ahead and read what you can do!

2 - QUICK REVISION OF SDK

The SDK (Standart Development Kit) only contains the Source Code of the 1.6.0 Version made in a Half-Life SDK 2.3.

The main "problem" (because Arrangement's Source Code was not free to public, at first) it's the contents of the Code. In some parts the code  seems to be "hard-coded" (make things work in the bad way). There are a lot of messages called and I used some cvars to interact with client side, in Player.cpp - Prethink().

You will see some comments in the Source Code, many of those comments seems to be in Spanish (sorry). After think on open my Source Code I start to write the new comments in English.

Remember to hit ALT+F7 if you want to change your compiler's options (.dll paths and so on).

3 - WHAT's NEW ON 1.9.0?

- New commented code.
- New folders and reorganization of files.
- Each file contains description of how it's changed (server side only).
- New BG Particle system (used for decals, explosion, blood bursts, smoke and more).
- New entities and effects added.
- New improvements on AI.
- Most important bugs removed.
- Code improvements.


4 - WHAT's LEFT?

Thanks to the people who help me in the previous version, there is not much to add. 

However we still need:

-Finish some actual code in the Mod. The developers can see what's left typing "//to do" (without quotes) at the "Search" window.
-We added new schedules and we make new smart enemies (like monster_terrorist). Anyway we stiill need to add shoot&run improvement.
-Add 3D Sound, Shaders, Mirrors and real-time monitors. We have fully working source for that (thanks developers!) but is not integrated on Arrangement. If you want to cooperate whit us, we can send it those packages to you, if you want to add them into Arrangement's source code.
-Play .AVI files in game. Just before release this new version, I fully linked Avikit for that purpose, but I need to create a .AVI loader and a new entity to use it easily on hammer. It doesn't seems to be difficulty just glGenTextures, glBindTexture, glEnable, glTexImage2D and finally FSOUND_Init.
