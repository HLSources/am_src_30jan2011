Hello,

Thanks for download our demo and for check out this source code.

Before start, there are a few things you need to know:

-The Weapons folder contains all Am's weapons used in game. If you check the main folder you could find
a few weapons I don't use, so look for them. You might find them useful.
-The Monsters folder contains all the NPCs used in game.
-The Developers folder contains a few descriptions about Am and the updated FGD. The file Developers Readme it's not
properly updated so don't think the things you going to read are true, I modified A LOT the source, so somethings could
not work as expected
-The MonstersAIExtended contains the lastest NPCs I made. They've new AI based for Heart of Evil mod, from Nam
(modified under the terms of GNU Public License). They are so modified to make my own enemies and allies better
-The Weapons HL2 contains all the weapons that when be used on C17's derivation. THEY ARE NOT INCLUDED ON THE
COMPILATION, not even the precache and other related funcs. If you want to use it you MUST add a new preprocessor
definition, like "_COMPILE_REBIRTH" (whitout quotes)
-All weapons, effects, entities and everything that's not credited is made by me. Perhaps I forgot to give
credits to someone, so, I apologize for that and send me a line of what you did and you will be included on the
next release.
-If you use a few lines of this files and you want to give me credit as codder: do it. If you don't want: you
are not obligated to do so but I'd like to know why you are using this crappy code :P

Right. That's all you need to know. 

If you can't understand how somethings work, drop me a quick line at:

I hope you find this files useful. Enjoy them as you wish :)

Best regards people,

Claudio 'SysOp' Ficara
